# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A tic-tac-toe game project I coded using python.

This is just a beginners practice on coding. I did my best
not to look at other tutorials/reference on building the logic 
of this game, even though it is a relatively simple game to code.

After I finished, I compared it to other tictactoe codes. I am very happy
that my take on coding this game, specially the checking of winner, is somewhat similar
to other codes that I have looked at. Yes, this is just a very simple achievement but
atleast I learned a lot from this project.

### Things I've Learned
* Practiced OOP
* Practiced List Comprehension
* Learned of '//' operator on python, returns only the integer
  part of a division
* Learned the str.join() method
  * a method that joins a list of string
  * an opposite string method is str.split(), which returns
    a list of string of specified delimiter
* Practiced on using Git and Github
